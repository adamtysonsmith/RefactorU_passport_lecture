PassportJS
Module that makes it easy to implement login via:
- Facebook (does not send data to facebook unless you choose to, but you can access some of the user's basic facebook info)
- Twitter (does not send data to twitter unless you choose to)
- Google
- Local Login (Your Site)

Local login is when you are handling usernames and passwords
- More insecure, so you need to encrypt passwords in the DB using SSL
- If you are taking credit cards, use Stripe.
- Use OAuth because its more secure than your local will ever be
